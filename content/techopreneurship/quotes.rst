Rick Alden
----------

Conservative guys buy core products, but core guys will never buy conservative. 
In other words, we've got to be edgy and keep our original consumer happy, 
because without him, we'll lose people like me -- old guys who want to buy 
cool young products, too. We're the guys who sit behind a desk more than we sit 
on a mountain bike, but we want to believe we still belong in that world. 
We all still want to be cool. ~ `How I Did It: Rick Alden, Skullcandy <http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-i-did-it-rick-alden-skullcandy.html>`_
