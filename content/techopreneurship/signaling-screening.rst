Signaling and Screening
=======================

:status: draft

One common sense concept which I find interesting from Managerial Economics is about the Adverse Selection.
It is under the topic of asymetric information. Adverse Selection is the one of the inefficiency caused by a hidden information. 
In Asymetric information, this happened when one side of the player know the truth of itself whereas the other don't.
To understand the inefficiency and the problem, you have to search for it.

To solve the issuee however, there are two parts, signaling and screening.

In signaling, the informed side send a signal about his/her type. 
For example, in applying for job, a very good programmer share to the interviewer his/her past code commit history. 
The programmer send a signal hoping that the interviewer realize that this programmer is indeed a very good.

In screening, the uninformed side provide a scheme such that the informed side reveal true type.
For example, in job interview, an interviewer prepare a couple algorithms questions.
The interviewer screen the programmer hoping that he/she shows the true color.


I find this signaling and screening is very important practices because in real life most of the time we know ourself and not knowing others.
Such as, Buying a cheap or 2nd hand item (worrying about the quality of it), applying for job (showing some proof), and many more.

And recently, I've been designing a web application with two type of consumer. One is the active user, while other is the pasive user.
After knowing about signaling and screening, I realize I need to provide some scheme to screen the user in our website.
Create a scheme such that the active user stay, whereas the pasive user leave.
