Background
----------
From the end of the cold war, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union 
South Ossetia had been a under territorial dispute between the Russia 
Federation as well as the Republic of Georgia. South Ossetia declared 
unilateral independence from Georgia in 1991 which was not recognised by 
Georgia. Later in 2004 Georgia started a campaign for the reintegration of 
territories back to Georgia but South Ossetia having strong ties with russia 
proved more difficult to integrate back with it still declaring the be an 
independent state. 

Conflicts only began to arise in 2007 when Georgia invested $12 million into 
South Ossetia (Georgia did not recognise the legitimacy of the south Ossetia 
government) and thus had parallel civil administration which did not please 
South Ossetia and Russia who was backing them. To make things worse Georgian 
also tried to shut down the black market which was a significant source of 
income for the South Ossetia government. In 2008 Russia begin granting Russian 
citizenship and passports to the populations of South Ossetia which angered 
Georgia.

Later in 8 July 2008, Russian military planes entered South Ossetian airspace 
triggering Georgia retaliation causing small arms fire Georgian and South 
Ossetian troops until 7 August, when Georgia and separatist forces agreed to a 
ceasefire. However a surprise assault was started by Georgia claiming it was 
to protect it civilian from Russian troops triggering Russia to send 
mechanized formations. Georgia reacted by officially declaring a 15-day state 
of war and hostilities continued for five days and officially ceased on 
12 August with a peace agreement signed in the next few days.


Introduction
------------

As cyberspace is the top worry of Pentagon’s second-ranking official 
(American Forces Press Service, 2010) ,in this case study I will share on 
the cyber-war that took place during 2008 which originated due to the 
territorial dispute of South Ossetia between South Ossetia government and 
Georgia. I will explore the attacks that had taken place as well as the 
outcome those attacks had on Georgia as well as its population which was 
carried out by South Ossetia’s ally, Russia.

The use of cyberspace in my opinion played an important role in determining 
the outcome of the war as it was used alongside with traditional military 
tactics to create the citizens impression of the war that had/was going 
to happen.

Cyber Reconnaissance
--------------------
Project Grey Goose is open source intelligence initiative to investigate the Russia Georgia cyber-attack. The researcher identified that Russian hackers did cyber reconnaissance before the attack, the vulnerabilities of Georgia Website has been identified before August 8, 2008. During the cyber-attack, they immediately sending the attack packet and taking down the site. This shows that the attack code and tools has been done in advance. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 181)

Cyber war that had occurred
---------------------------
As early as 21 July 2008, the first cyber-attack by the Russian has knock out the President Georgia’s Website with a DoS attack.

There were multiple attacks during the period between and during the war and the attacks came in different forms and had achieved different effects. The most common form of attack was DDOS but there was also other forms at which the defence against those type of methods had cause other forms of impact on Russia’s target, Georgia citizens.

Non-State Cyber Warrior
-----------------------
There are different channel where hactivism started building up their power. In StopGeorgia.ru forum there were 30 members initially and had become 200 members in September 15, 2008. This forum provides some tools including the DDoS toolkit and some guide for the SQL injection for their members to launch the attacks. It also lists of all the 37 valuable targets. While other hacktivist used IRC channel #stopgeorgia on irc.dalnet.ru to organise the attack.¬¬ (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, pp. 15-16)

In this forum, there are hieratical roles. The forum leader, who has higher technical skill will analyse and oversee the overall progress of the attack providing necessary tools and information of the targets and their weaknesses. However during the campaign they didn’t carry out the attacks but instead the low technical skill member were the ones who carry out the attacks. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, pp. 15-16)

The Pre-emptive Strike
----------------------
The organized hacktivism is highly coordinated that capable to launch the DDoS attack on the Georgian forums to take out Georgian Hackers as a pre-emptive strike and to mitigate a counter attack from Georgian hackers. Unfortunately, Georgian hackers made a successful counter attack by launching a DDoS attack on Novosti, a Moscow news service. (Keizer, 2008)

The Intel
---------
The Russia hacktivism community is very strong. They share information among each other’s. They are pro-Russia hacker’s community. It was said that they grow without any support from the government and yet they were able to find the government plans and launch the cyber-attack towards the Georgia. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 115)

But it is hard to believe that the cyber-attack was purely started by the hacktivism, without any involvement from the Government. This situation changed after February 2009 where Russian media provided evidence that shown that the government is sponsoring the attack. 

During the interview with Anna Bukovskaya, a Nashi member who received funds for a spy program against Nashi opposition party had leaked one critical information that could leads to the Russia Cyber Intel. According to the interview, Russian Ren TV, on 4 February 2009, she highlighted that the spy program includes compromising the opposition party data from the computer. With that evidence, Nashi, were also involved in some of the cyber-attacks. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 117)

Konstantin Goloskov, one of the youth leaders in Nashi, also admitted his involvement in cyber-attack DDoS to Estonia in 27 April 2007. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 3)

Sergei Makarov, a state duma deputy and member of the Unified Russia party and a supporter of Nashi, attended its second annual Innovation forum on 21 July 2008, the day after the Georgia’s President Website came under DoS attack. It’s strong evidence that the government has sponsored the cyber-attack. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 118)

Russia cyber-warfare command is delivered via a political channel such as the Nashi Youth Movement in which the members will start the attack while gathering additional power from the public (especially for DDoS attack).

There is a three tier command and control model used in Russia. The top of the tier, the government, funds and delivers the order to Nashi. Nashi as the next tier gathers further power from the public, which generate the hacktivism as the last tier.

Organized Cyber-crime
---------------------
Russian Business Network is an organized crime in Russia that was first to be detected to launch the cyber-attack on Georgian sites. They are considered criminal solution service provider, which include phishing, malware hosting, gambling, etc… It also provides a good server platform to launch the attacks (Command and Control(C&C Server).

In Russia, government utilize these organized crimes for a mutualism partnership.  The government make well used of these organizations for state interest. In exchange, the government provide a protection scheme for them. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, p. 123)


DDoS
----
The first form of attack I will cover is DDOS which occurred several times. DDOS attacks were targeted on several Georgian sites, the first case is an attack on several government websites like the `website of President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia <www.president.gov.ge>`_ (Adair, 2008). The website was down for more than 24hours by flooding request over multiple ports, the ports that are flooded are mainly http, tcp and icmp. Attacks are coordinated by a command and control (C&C) server which instructs other computers aka bots which will keep launching request at the targeted server.

In order to counter the incoming attacks Georgia began to implement filters to prevent all Russian IP addresses form accessing. Although this counter was successful but it was shot lived as the attackers began to use software to mask their IP addresses as well as shifting their attacks to come from outside of Russia. As you can see form the chart to the right indicate the sources of the compromised computers (bots) that were being used for the attack. However from what we can see the main source of the attack is from Germany, United States and Russia but out of the 3, 2 of them are not directly involve in the conflict but they contribute the 2 highest number of attack source. (Ronald J. Deibert, February 2012 vol. 43 ) 

The bots that were used in the attack did not know that they were used. This was because they had a malware installed into the computer. This causes the infected computer to become a “zombie” and during the attack the C&C server will issue a command to all the bots to attack or it may be also preprogramed to attack at a pre-allocated time.

Although some users did not know their computers were used in the hacking, hactivist are also reached out during the process by releasing easy to use software to the masses allowing them to be hactivist as well. This allowed them to get more computers to add on to the computing power required to flood the Georgian servers causing them to be rendered out of service. 

A move made by the Georgian government to hopefully counter the DDoS attacks was to mirror their government website overseas using an American service provider Tulip Systems. However Tulip Systems did not inform the US authorities that they were hosting another country’s governmental website. Soon the servers that hosted the websites were under DDOS attacks. The CEO of Tulip Systems report the attacks to the FBI but at no avail as there was no approval given by the US government thus no sanction was given.

The effect of a DDOS has a devastating effect to key services. An example of this will be the impact of Georgian financial sector. On 9 August 2008 Georgia’s biggest bank TBC was under attack which made the Central bank of Georgia to order all banks to stop offering electronic services (CERT Estonia experts from Georgia). The restriction was lifted on the 18 August 2008 to allow banks to function as per normal but additional restrictions were placed on loans (National Bank of Georgia).

Hacking 
-------
Websites had been defaced for example, `websites of the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs <http://mfa.gov.ge>`_ and `the president <http://president.gov.ge>`_ where both defaced to show pro-Russian graffiti on government sites such as a pictures of Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, to Adolf Hitler.

This is achieved by finding vulnerabilities in a website and then exploiting them. One good example will be SQL injection which any text field on a webpage to communicate directly with the backend database. What this entails to the hacker is that they will gain sensitive information that is stored on the database of the website. A compromised website also allows it’s hacker to edit/destroy its content which may prove disastrous. There are instances of hacked websites had all of their content removed or like the cased above they were edited to show Russian graffiti.

SQL Injection
-------------
Since they had recon the target, they understand the vulnerabilities of the target. The StopGeorgia.ru forum discussed mostly about traditional DoS, but with a slightly unique tactic such that it uses SQL injection and took advantage of the application vulnerabilities of the Georgia sites. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, pp. 141-143)

SQL injection is the attack that takes advantage of badly written code such that it doesn’t follow the security practices. The attackers will then try to executing arbitrary SQL queries on the target database machine via the web application loop hole. If then the attacker identified that there’s indeed SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application, it will be able to execute any queries or command on the database server. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, pp. 141-143)

Russian Hackers utilized the SQL injection technique to execute a crypto function in the target machine which then will take a huge amount of resources and causes the machines stall. With this technique, an attack from a single machine could take down the Georgia servers. (Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare. 2nd Ed, 2011, pp. 141-143)

Online propagandas 
------------------
Propagandas are attacks that target on the minds of the reader is interesting form of attack that had occurred during this war as it effective on peoples morale and had a greater effect when actions had been taken against it or when there are no other information to deny .

Russia started off by spreading their propaganda in their own web sites and media this promotes the Russian side of the story as it will allow the Russians to believe that Russia is right and Georgia is wrong. However Russian media is aired in Georgia letting Georgia’s civilians to hear both countries propaganda.

As Russia have all their propagandas over their media Georgia begin to terminate terrestrial broadcasting of Russia’s television and radio under the claim of it being it to be inaccurate and inflam¬matory. Georgia Internet service provider (ISP) also began to filter content that comes from Russia. However this restricted access on the media had caused unintended consequences as it occurred the same time a strike on Georgian broadcast transmitters leaving the country in an information blackout. This causes them to lose the ability to spread its own propaganda causing their citizen to be in a state of panic as they did not have any information to rely on. The effect of an information blackout only became worse when rumour of Russian forces were advancing on the capital. 

However propaganda can now only happen in the affected countries (Russia, South Ossetia & Georgia) as other media channels like BBC and CNN who are based in Europe and the US respectively begin to broadcast Georgian side of the story letting them have public support. It is said that the Russians are losing the “propaganda war”, BBC reported, allies have succeeded in “presenting the Russian actions as aggression and playing down the Georgian attack into South Ossetia on 7 August, which triggered the Russian operation” (BBC News, 2008).
