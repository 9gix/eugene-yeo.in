Judo: My Gentle Ways
=====================

:status: draft

I love to play judo. 

My friends are very helpful during the training.

I play with my heart. I feel and sense the motion of my opponents. 

Technique is very important. It helps me to throw someone heavier.

When I throw, I try to minimize the force needed. 

I only win by Ippon. 
Win by Hansoku make, Shido, Waza-ari, Yuko or Koka is not in my dictionary.
