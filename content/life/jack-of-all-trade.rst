Jack of All Trade, Master of None

:status: draft

It all begin when I was studying science.

I moved on to explore about computer.

Then I study enterpreneurship which lead me to study breadth knowledge.

It may seems very hard to make a U-turn when you've made a long journey ahead. 
And you believe that your destination is just another miles left.
But in fact, I didn't make the U-turn. Instead, I waited for junction for me 
to make a left or right turn. I didn't want to make the U-turn,
I am progressing forward. Whatever happened, cannot be undone. 
If I go back, I will back to zero. I have to explore a different path.
