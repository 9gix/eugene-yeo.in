The Room
========

:status: draft

I wake up in a different room. I didn't realize that until I went to the bathroom.
After some time, I thinking what's happening. And trying to remember how 
I ended up in a different room. I ran back to my original room with a lost mind.

After a while, I remember that yesterday I made room transfer with the admin.
