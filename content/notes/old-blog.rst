I've decided to start a new blog, because the old blog grew quite big 
in term of its functionality. It is able to track down the visitors, etc. 
The old blog is written in Django. Moreover, I host it own my EC2. (Expensive)

Legacy Blogs: `eugene-yeo.me <http://eugene-yeo.me/>`_
I'm not planning to keep the server running for a long period of time.

I just need a simple text that allow me to communicate to other developer.
And the main idea is just to share and transfer my knowledge to others.

With the new blog, I'm able to focus on the content. Without having to 
worry about the design aesthetics. and admin stuff.

And the cost for hosting this blog is relatively valuable. It is hosted in S3 
with less than a megabyte. (Paying only few cents a month)

If you're curious about this techblog, checkout Pelican. It is a static site generator.
