Bitcoin for public
------------------

Bitcoin acts as a new currency system. Instead of dollars, it is bitcoins.
However, we are not that rich to own a bitcoin. As a average income, we usually
have only micro or milli bitcoin. As of now the exchange rate is very unstable,
but as of now, 9 Jun 2014, 1BTC = SGD 810.

Transfering money via Bitcoin is anonymous. Anyone can see the address,
unfortunately the address is a random character and doesn't pin point to anyone.
You then use this address to transfer money to another address, which only you
as a sender should know who you're sending to. Even the receiver doesn't
necessarily know who the senders are. Again, the receiver address is also
anonymous.

Bitcoin address is in the form of a random characters. Sometime, these random
character is also encoded into a barcode, so mobile user can scan the address to
send a money to the target user.

The downside however, the transaction is not immidiately completed. Both have to
wait for a couple minutes before the transaction is done. This is because every
transaction need to be verified by 6 other verifier.

There are many ways to convert your real money into virtual currency Bitcoin.
One of which I will talk about is via Bitcoin ATM.

Bitcoin ATM
-----------

Bitcoin ATM is more like a vending machine. If you want to buy bitcoin,
you have to insert real money, then the machine will transfer you the bitcoin.
Or if you want to sell bitcoin, you transfer your bitcoin to the machine, the
machine will then withdraw some real cash.

As a new user, we usually don't know how to receive the bitcoin. Because bitcoin
is a virtual currency, all you need is your virtual wallet address. There are
many ways to generate a wallet address. You can generate a virtual wallet from
your mobile or computer, or even in printed paper. Mostlikely, you need the
address in the form of barcode, so that a machine (e.g. the ATM) can scan your
address and transfer it to that address.

When you have your bitcoin in your wallet, can use it for anything that allowed.
Such as shopping, for online payment, etc. So do when you lost this wallet, your
money is gone forever and cannot be recovered. That said, paper wallet is the
safest way to store you address as it has physical attribute just like your real
money.

When you want to withdrawn your money, you will transfer the money to the ATM
and once the ATM confirmed the bitcoin is received, the money will be dispensed.
