Don Norman (The design of everyday things)
------------------------------------------

Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, 
in part because good designs fit our needs so well
that the design is invisible, serving us 
without drawing attention to itself.
Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, 
making itself very noticable.

So many things we take for granted without questioning why

Charles Mingus

Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity.
