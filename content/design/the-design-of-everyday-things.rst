Discoverability is the ability to spot the actions that could be performs
from an object. Meanwhile Understanding is knowing what the object 
and its actions used for. Object has to have clear cues for us to discover 
and understand purpose and actions.

A complex object usually require instruction manual, however not for 
a simple object. When objects could performs too many actions, 
we tends to remember only few of the actions that works 
and ignore the rest of the actions.
